# OpenVPN AWS

**OpenVPN instance**. Which includes 
[**OpenVPN container**](https://github.com/d3vilh/openvpn-aws/tree/master/openvpn/openvpn-docker) with simple [**WEB UI**](https://github.com/d3vilh/openvpn-ui) as lightweight web administration interface:

![OpenVPN WEB UI](/images/OpenVPN-UI-Home.png)

# Requirements
- [**Amazon AWS EC2 T2 Micro Instance**](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/t2/) 1x CPU Core, 1Gb RAM
- [**Amazon AWS Debian amd64 AMI**](https://wiki.debian.org/Cloud/AmazonEC2Image/Bullseye),Debian 11 Bullseye
- **At least 8Gb GP2 Storage**
- **Opened UDP/1194 and TCP/8080** ports (TCP/8080 necessary for [OpenVPN-UI](https://github.com/d3vilh/openvpn-ui) initial configuration only)
> Theoretically [OpenVPN AWS](https://github.com/d3vilh/openvpn-aws) will run on EC2 T2 Nano Instance (1x CPU Core, 512Mb RAM), but it was never tested.

# Installation

  1. Install [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html) and Git:
     ```shell 
     sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip git rsync
     pip3 install ansible
     ```
  2. Clone this repository: 
     ```shell
     git clone https://github.com/d3vilh/openvpn-aws
     ```
  3. Then enter the repository directory: 
     ```shell 
     cd openvpn-aws
     ```
  4. Install requirements: 
     ```shell
     ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml
     ```
     > If you see `ansible-galaxy: command not found`, you have to relogin and then try again.
  5. Make copies of the configuration files and modify them for your enviroment:
     ```shell
     yes | cp -p example.inventory.ini inventory.ini 
     yes | cp -p example.config.yml config.yml
     ```
  6. Run the following command to add the `docker` group if it doesn't exist and add user to the `docker` group:
     ```shell
     sudo groupadd docker
     sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
     ```
  7. Modify `inventory.ini` by replace of IP address with your EC2's Public or Private IPv4 address, or comment that line and uncomment the `connection=local` line if you're running it on the EC2 itself.

  8. Run installation playbook:
     ```shell
     ansible-playbook main.yml
     ```
> **If running locally on the EC2**: You may have error like `Error while fetching server API version` or `Permission denied`. You have to relogin and then run the playbook again.

  9. Now, open your [EC2 console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home) and go to `"Network & Security"` > `"Security Groups"` to create two new Security groups for opening OpenVPN UDP/1194 and OpenVPN-UI TCP/8080 ports for your EC2 instance.

  10. Configure Security Group for OpenVPN (to open UDP/1194 port for Public access):

  <img src="https://github.com/d3vilh/openvpn-aws/blob/master/images/OpenVPN-EC2-OVPN-Only.png" alt="Opening EC2 Public OVPN Port" width="600" border="1" />

  11. Configure Security Group for OpenVPN-UI (to open TCP/8080 port for Public access):

  <img src="https://github.com/d3vilh/openvpn-aws/blob/master/images/OpenVPN-EC2-UI-Only.png" alt="Opening EC2 Public OpenVPN-UI Port" width="600" border="1" />

  12. Assign both Security groups to your running EC2 instance.

  13. **Generate first .OVPN profile** as described below, with **"Trusted"** subnet IP (`10.0.70.0/24`) via OpenVPN-UI web GUI and connect with it, to check your setup.

  14. Now when you have OpenVPN-UI access over VPN you **MUST** remove OpenVPN-UI Security group profile from you EC2 instance settings. **Because of security reasons!!!**

# Usage

**OpenVPN WEB UI** can be accessed on own port (*e.g. http://localhost:8080 , change `localhost` to your EC2's Public or Private IPv4 address*), the default user and password is `admin/gagaZush` preconfigured in `config.yml` which you supposed to [set in](https://github.com/d3vilh/openvpn-aws/blob/master/example.config.yml#L18) `ovpnui_user` & `ovpnui_password` vars, just before the installation.

The volume container will be inicialized by using the official OpenVPN `openvpn_openvpn` image with included scripts to automatically generate everything you need  on the first run:
 - Diffie-Hellman parameters
 - an EasyRSA CA key and certificate
 - a new private key
 - a self-certificate matching the private key for the OpenVPN server
 - a TLS auth key from HMAC security

This setup use `tun` mode, because it works on the widest range of devices. tap mode, for instance, does not work on Android, except if the device is rooted.

The topology used is `subnet`, because it works on the widest range of OS. p2p, for instance, does not work on Windows.

The server config [specifies](https://github.com/d3vilh/openvpn-aws/blob/master/openvpn/config/server.conf#L40) `push redirect-gateway def1 bypass-dhcp`, meaning that after establishing the VPN connection, all traffic will go through the VPN. This might cause problems if you use local DNS recursors which are not directly reachable, since you will try to reach them through the VPN and they might not answer to you. If that happens, use public DNS resolvers like those of OpenDNS (`208.67.222.222` and `208.67.220.220`) or Google (`8.8.4.4` and `8.8.8.8`).

### Generating .OVPN client profiles

Before client cert. generation you need to update the external IP address to your OpenVPN server in OVPN-UI GUI.

For this go to `"Configuration > Settings"`:

<img src="https://github.com/d3vilh/openvpn-aws/blob/master/images/OVPN_ext_serv_ip1.png" alt="Configuration > Settings" width="350" border="1" />

And then update `"Server Address (external)"` field with your external Internet IP. Then go to `"Certificates"`, enter new VPN client name in the field at the page below and press `"Create"` to generate new Client certificate:

<img src="https://github.com/d3vilh/openvpn-aws/blob/master/images/OVPN_ext_serv_ip2.png" alt="Server Address" width="350" border="1" />  <img src="https://github.com/d3vilh/openvpn-aws/blob/master/images/OVPN_New_Client.png" alt="Create Certificate" width="350" border="1" />

To download .OVPN client configuration file, press on the `Client Name` you just created:

<img src="https://github.com/d3vilh/openvpn-aws/blob/master/images/OVPN_New_Client_download.png" alt="download OVPN" width="350" border="1" />

If you use NAT and different port for all the external connections on your network router, you may need to change server port in .OVPN file. For that, just open it in any text editor (emax?) and update `1194` port with the desired one in this line: `remote 178.248.232.12 1194 udp`.
This line also can be [preconfigured in](https://github.com/d3vilh/openvpn-aws/blob/master/example.config.yml#L23) `config.yml` file in var `ovpn_remote`.

Install [Official OpenVPN client](https://openvpn.net/vpn-client/) to your client device.

Deliver .OVPN profile to the client device and import it as a FILE, then connect with new profile to enjoy your free VPN:

### Revoking .OVPN profiles

If you would like to prevent client to use yor VPN connection, you have to revoke client certificate and restart the OpenVPN daemon.
You can do it via OpenVPN WEB UI `"Certificates"` menue, by pressing Revoke red button:

<img src="https://github.com/d3vilh/openvpn-aws/blob/master/images/OpenVPN-UI-Revoke.png" alt="Revoke Certificate" width="600" border="1" />

Revoked certificates won't kill active connections, you'll have to restart the service if you want the user to immediately disconnect. It can be done via Portainer or OpenVPN WEB UI from the same `"Certificates"` page, by pressing Restart red button:

<img src="https://github.com/d3vilh/openvpn-aws/blob/master/images/OpenVPN-UI-Restart.png" alt="OpenVPN Restart" width="600" border="1" />

### OpenVPN client subnets. Guest and Home users

[OpenVPN-AWS'](https://github.com/d3vilh/openvpn-aws/) OpenVPN server uses `10.0.70.0/24` **"Trusted"** subnet for dynamic clients by default and all the clients connected by default will have full access to your AWS Private subnet, as well as external Internet access with EC2 Public IP.
However you can be desired to share VPN access with your friends and restrict access to your AWS Private network for them (so they wont access OpenVPN-UI GUI or other services), but allow to use Internet connection with EC2 Public IP. This type of guest clients needs to live in special **"Guest users"** subnet - `10.0.71.0/24`:

To assign desired subnet policy to the specific client, you have to define static IP address for this client after you generate .OVPN profile.

> Keep in mind, by default, all the clients have full access, so you don't need to specifically configure static IP for your own devices, your home devices always will land to **"Trusted"** subnet by default. 

### OpenVPN Pstree structure

All the Server and Client configuration located in Docker volume and can be easely tuned. Here are tree of volume content:

```shell
|-- clients
|   |-- your_client1.ovpn
|-- config
|   |-- client.conf
|   |-- easy-rsa.vars
|   |-- server.conf
|-- db
|   |-- data.db //OpenVPN UI DB
|-- log
|   |-- openvpn.log
|-- pki
|   |-- ca.crt
|   |-- certs_by_serial
|   |   |-- your_client1_serial.pem
|   |-- crl.pem
|   |-- dh.pem
|   |-- index.txt
|   |-- ipp.txt
|   |-- issued
|   |   |-- server.crt
|   |   |-- your_client1.crt
|   |-- openssl-easyrsa.cnf
|   |-- private
|   |   |-- ca.key
|   |   |-- your_client1.key
|   |   |-- server.key
|   |-- renewed
|   |   |-- certs_by_serial
|   |   |-- private_by_serial
|   |   |-- reqs_by_serial
|   |-- reqs
|   |   |-- server.req
|   |   |-- your_client1.req
|   |-- revoked
|   |   |-- certs_by_serial
|   |   |-- private_by_serial
|   |   |-- reqs_by_serial
|   |-- safessl-easyrsa.cnf
|   |-- serial
|   |-- ta.key
|-- staticclients //Directory where stored all the satic clients configuration
```

### Alternative, CLI ways to deal with OpenVPN configuration

To generate new .OVPN profile execute following command. Password as second argument is optional:
```shell
sudo docker exec openvpn bash /opt/app/bin/genclient.sh <name> <?password?>
```

You can find you .ovpn file under `/openvpn/clients/<name>.ovpn`, make sure to check and modify the `remote ip-address`, `port` and `protocol`. It also will appear in `"Certificates"` menue of OpenVPN WEB UI.

Revoking of old .OVPN files can be done via CLI by running following:

```shell
sudo docker exec openvpn bash /opt/app/bin/rmclient.sh <clientname>
```

Restart of OpenVPN container can be done via the CLI by running following:
```shell
sudo docker-compose restart openvpn
```

To define static IP, go to `~/openvpn/staticclients` directory and create text file with the name of your client and insert into this file ifrconfig-push option with the desired static IP and mask: `ifconfig-push 10.0.71.2 255.255.255.0`.

For example, if you would like to restrict Home subnet access to your best friend Slava, you should do this:

```shell
slava@Ukraini:~/openvpn/staticclients $ pwd
/home/slava/openvpn/staticclients
slava@Ukraini:~/openvpn/staticclients $ ls -lrt | grep Slava
-rw-r--r-- 1 slava heroi 38 Nov  9 20:53 Slava
slava@Ukraini:~/openvpn/staticclients $ cat Slava
ifconfig-push 10.0.71.2 255.255.255.0
```

> Keep in mind, by default, all the clients have full access, so you don't need to specifically configure static IP for your own devices, your home devices always will land to **"Trusted"** subnet by default.
